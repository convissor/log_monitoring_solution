Obtaining
---------
This package can either be downloaded at
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/software/download/
or using Git.  Git is nice because it permits easy integration of any
enhancements we make with your settings changes.  The release branch is named
"2".  Development happens in master.

    git clone git://github.com/convissor/log_monitoring_solution.git
    cd log_monitoring_solution
    git checkout --track -b 2 origin/2


Settings
--------
This package contains settings in both init.d/log_monitoring_solution and
bin/log_monitoring_solution.  Please take a look at both files.

The most likely thing users will have to adjust is PHP_LOG_FILE in the init.d
file.  It indicates where the PHP log file can be found.

If you are using a Git checkout, once things are working properly, commit your
settings so the local repository will be ready for merging future updates.

    git commit -a -m 'Local settings.'

----------
cp bin/log_monitoring_solution /usr/local/bin
cp init.d/log_monitoring_solution /etc/init.d
