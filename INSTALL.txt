Obtaining
---------
This package can be downloaded either via Git or via a tar file from our web
site http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/software/download/

Git is nice because it permits easy integration of any changes we make with any
changes you make for settings.  The release branch is named "2".
Development happens in master.

    git clone git://github.com/convissor/log_monitoring_solution.git
    cd log_monitoring_solution
    git checkout --track -b 2 origin/2


Settings
--------
This package contains settings in both init.d/log_monitoring_solution and
bin/log_monitoring_solution.  Please take a look at both files.

The most likely thing users will have to adjust is PHP_LOG_FILE in the init.d
script.  It indicates where the PHP log file can be found.

If you are using a Git checkout, once things are working properly, commit your
settings so your local repository will be ready for merging our future updates.

    git commit -a -m 'Local settings.'


Installing
----------
The following steps put our scripts in the default locations.  If different
locations are used, make the corresponding adjustments to the DAEMON and
SCRIPTNAME settings in our init.d script.

cp bin/log_monitoring_solution /usr/local/bin
cp init.d/log_monitoring_solution /etc/init.d

chmod 754 /usr/local/bin/log_monitoring_solution
chmod 754 /etc/init.d/log_monitoring_solution


Running
-------
/etc/init.d/log_monitoring_solution start


Logging
-------
The Log Monitoring Solution produces its own status log.  The default location
of this log is /var/log/log_monitoring_solution.log.  The setting can be
changed via the $local_log setting in our bin script.
