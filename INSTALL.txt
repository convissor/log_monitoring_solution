Obtaining
---------
This package can either be downloaded at
http://www.analysisandsolutions.com/software/download/
or using Git.  Git is nice because it permits easy integration of any
enhancements we make with your settings changes.  The release branch is named
stable.  Development happens in master.

    git clone git://github.com/convissor/log_monitoring_solution.git
    cd log_monitoring_solution
    git checkout --track -b stable origin/stable


Installing
----------
Both log_monitoring_solution.pl and log_monitoring_solution_runner.sh must be
put in the same directory.  We suggest /usr/local/bin.


Settings
--------
Go through the settings section in log_monitoring_solution.pl and make any
adjustments necessary.

The log_monitoring_solution_runner.sh script redirects Perl errors to
/var/log/log_monitoring_solution.log.  That path may need adjusting in your
environment.  The script also provides other examples for handling Perl errors.
Examine log_monitoring_solution_runner.sh for more information.

Edit the $SCRIPT_DIR setting in log_monitoring_solution_crontab.txt.

If you are using a Git checkout, once things are working properly, commit your
settings so the local repository will be ready for merging future updates.

    git commit -a -m 'Local settings.'


Running
-------
While log_monitoring_solution.pl is the script that does the work, it is
started and managed by log_monitoring_solution_runner.sh.

log_monitoring_solution_runner.sh should be executed by a cron job on a regular
basis.  The package ships with a sample crontab file,
log_monitoring_solution_crontab.txt, containing the following:

    # The path to the log_monitoring_solution_runner.sh script.
    # Feel free to use this variable for other scripts as well.
    SCRIPT_DIR=/usr/local/bin

    # Check on the Log Monitoring Solution every 5 minutes.
    */5 * * * *  $SCRIPT_DIR/log_monitoring_solution_runner.sh

That file can be loaded into the cron system as follows:

    crontab log_monitoring_solution_crontab.txt
