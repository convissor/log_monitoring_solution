The Log Monitoring Solution is a Perl script that watches the log file
of your chosing in real time for any matches against the regular
expression you provide and notifies you of them via email.

Keeps track of duplicate errors and sends the resulting count of them
at intervals, rather than clogging inboxes with one email per error.

Gracefully handles situations where the log file doesn't exist yet,
gets rotated or truncated.

Comes pre-configured to monitor fatal and parse errors generated by
PHP scripts.  Monitoring my PHP Error Logs is the reason I wrote this
script in the first place.  This approach is necessary for two reasons.
First, while user-defined error handlers are excellent, if PHP goes
fatal, so does the error handler.  Second, if the PHP install is really
broken, a log observer written in PHP won't do much good.
